Develop unwrapping from 
- json object
- array list
Note:
- {} denotes unwrapping an json object
- {} denotes unwrapping a json array list
  - reminder: ("0")
- the variable type is shown by the value in the key:value pair
  - reminder: java is a strongly formatted language
  - String
  - int or long
  - float or double
  - other vaiables as needed

Finally: loading images from open weather map
- concatenate a URL to the image from
  - https://openweathermap.org/api
  - https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#list1
  - https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
- Note: image string / file extension / server call for 2 times (other numbers do not work)
  - 2x recommended as image can be resized based on display
  - will not be as pixelated if resized to a bigger size
